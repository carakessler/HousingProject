		<h4>Here are a couple quick reminders to get you started:</h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>You are going to be registering either for a 6 person suite, a 4 person connected double, a 3 person suite, a double, or a single.  Once you register for these options, you will be emailed a specific date and time in which you will pick your housing.</li>
				<li>Make sure everyone in your group confirms that they are in the group.  Otherwise, your group will not get registered and you will not be able to register for the housing type that your group desires</li>
				<li>If you are in a group, the person with the best time will choose the housing for your group.  Once the time comes around, he/she will be allowed to choose housing until the end of the registration day.</li>
				<li>Drawing for a specific type of housing will close once all the rooms in that type of housing have been filled.  If you had been closed out of the drawing for a particular type of housing, you will be forced to re-register with a revised group to have a shot at another type of housing.</li>
				<li>If you have any questions or comments, email us at housing@reslife.rochester.edu, or call us at (585) 275-3166 during normal business hours.</li>
