##Housing Project
Many people believe that the current housing system at the University of Rochester is unfair.  Using the feedback our group obtained from the first project, we came up with a new housing system that we thought would be more fair to students at the university.  


##Lottery Procedure
Students will have to register beforehand in either a 6 person suite, a 4 person connected double, a 3 person suite, a double, or a single.  Each of these catagories will register on a specific day.  If a group is locked out of all choices on a specific day, they will have a day to re-register their group and enter the next day's drawing.  <br/>  <br/> 

Our housing system uses the old seniority system, where each class of students are assigned a certain amount of points.  Sophomores are worth 1 point, Juniors are worth 2 points, and Seniors are worth 3 points.  Registration times will be randomized within each specific set of points.   A group with a higher amount of points will have a higher priority than other groups.  For example, a group of all seniors with 18 points will have an earlier registration time than a group of sophomores with 6 points. <br/><br/>
