#Housing Project

Many people believe that the current housing system at the University of Rochester is unfair.  Using the feedback our group obtained from the first project, we came up with a new housing system that we thought would be more fair to students at the university.  


##Lottery Procedure
Students will have to register beforehand in either a 6 person suite, a 4 person connected double, a 3 person suite, a double, or a single.  Each of these catagories will register on a specific day.  If a group is locked out of all choices on a specific day, they will have a day to re-register their group and enter the next day's drawing.  <br/>  <br/> 

Our housing system uses the old seniority system, where each class of students are assigned a certain amount of points.  Sophomores are worth 1 point, Juniors are worth 2 points, and Seniors are worth 3 points.  Registration times will be randomized within each specific set of points.   A group with a higher amount of points will have a higher priority than other groups.  For example, a group of all seniors with 18 points will have an earlier registration time than a group of sophomores with 6 points. <br/><br/>
- **Day 1:** Drawing for 6 person suites <br/> 
- **Day 2:** Drawing for singles <br/> 
- **Day 3:** Drawing for 4 person suites in Riverview and 2 person suites in Riverview <br/> 
- **Day 4:** Drawing for 4 person cluster doubles in O'Brien and the Residential Quad <br />
- **Day 5:** Drawing for doubles in all upperclassman double locations <br />
- **Day 6:** Drawing for all 3 person and 2 person suites in Southside <br />

##What our website can do
The website's primary function is a simulation of our proposed housing system.  Though not all functionality is complete, we inculuded features that will allow the user to simulate our housing process.  The user can register a group within the system, and then register that group into a specific room on campus. All buildings are complete with all levels, rooms, and floor plans.  Furthermore, the user can learn more information about the buildings on the info page, and find more support on the support page.
