Lottery proceedure:
	- first round of selection will be 6 people.
		+ If the user is not planning on entering the lottery of 6 people then they will have the option of skipping this entry
		+ 1st person in the group to sign in will be asked to enter 5 other group mebers
		+ The next 5 people to login will be asked to veriy this group list
			*If someone n teh group does not accept then there will be an alert that goes to everyone that says that not everyoine accepted
		+ once all 5 people have verified then teh group will be submitted to the lottery
			* If someone has been entered into more than 1 six person group then an alert will go out to them
		
		- There is going to be a timer that says when the lottery draws will take place so that everyone knows how much time they have
	- 2nd round will be 3 person and 2 person lottery in southside.
		+ The user after filling out group for 6 person user will be prompted to enter group for 3 person
			>> I thought that this would be best because then the user has backup groups if in teh case they do not get their top choice of housing.
			   It is my belief that it will greatly relieve the anxiety of a possible scramble for alternate roommates in the case taht user does not acquire
			   6 person housing 
		+ If user does not wish to apply for housing in southside, they have option to skip name entry for 3 person
		+ Same process will take place in that if
