			As members of your college community, we are aware that the initial
			housing lottery at the University of Rochester is very convoluted 
			and inefficient. Our team of software Developers think we have derived
			a solution that can improve the process. 
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>
			We would like to welcome you to the new and updated housing lottery 
			website! We have been workign hard to piece together a housing lottery
			system based on your responses in the survey and any suggestions and tips 
			that we received from all of you. 
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>
			So in a large part your ideas fueled this project and in a major way you
			helped us create this!
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>
			Our research into the housing lottery system, led us to to figure out
			how it works at present, what the general sentiment is across our student 
			body. We made an attempt to analyze your responses to derive an answer 
			to all of our problems.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>
			By creating this product, we hope that we will be able to alleviate the 
			uncertainty, confusion and anxiety that can be attributed directly to the 
			housing lottery process.
